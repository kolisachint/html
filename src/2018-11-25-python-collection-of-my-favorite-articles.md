# The best of Python: a collection of my favorite articles from 2017 and 2018 (so far)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*DxK6U9emVBkSotKCeyAyOw.jpeg)I divided the collected articles into 10 categories

### My intention with publishing this collection

Last year I only used Medium for **consuming content**, and I checked out a ton of Python-related articles. Recently I’ve started to use the **communityfeatures** of the platform, for instance following fellow developers. I also developed the practice of clapping and highlighting the most interesting parts of their articles. **My goal is to be an active member** of the developer community gathered on Medium.

I also realized that I would like to **give back to the community** after reading so many great resources. This was one of my main motivations for writing my first article [“Why you need Python environments and how to manage them with Conda”](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-you-need-python-environments-and-how-to-manage-them-with-conda-85f155f4353c).

In this article, I’d like to share with you the **articles I found most interesting and insightful (inspiring) last year and this year (so far)**. My other goal was to create a comprehensive list of the most valuable pieces **for my Python students**.

### How to navigate this article

I bookmarked so many great resources that it was not easy to select the best ones. So I divided the article into **10 categories** — this, by the way, resonates well with the **versatile and multipurpose nature of Python**.

The categories are:

[1\. General Python programming](#c30e)

[2\. Python performance optimization](#90ec)

[3\. Python development environments and DevOps](#e770)

[4\. Machine learning](#58ae)

[5\. Image and video processing](#9d56)

[6\. Chatbots and Natural language processing (NLP)](#6b5e)

[7\. Blockchain](#a782)

[8\. Web and backend development](#0e75)

[9\. Web scraping](#2b67)

[10\. Data visualization](#c6cd)

Just one more thing before you dive in: **how should you use this article**? It doesn’t need to be read all at once. **Bookmark it**, and use it as a starting point or a reference point. With the **category list above, you can navigate** to the sections that you are interested in most.

And please **let me know in a comment** if you feel that I left out an awesome resource so I can update my collection. Thanks in advance!

### 1\. General Python programming

#### 1.5 How — and why — you should use Python Generators, by [Radu Raicea](https://medium.com/@Radu_Raicea)

This tutorial showcases examples of an **iterator class** and different types of **generator functions**.

> “**Generator functions** allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator. They allow programmers to make an iterator in a fast, easy, and clean way.”
> “An [**iterator**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator) is an object that can be iterated (looped) upon. It is used to abstract a container of data to make it behave like an iterable object. You probably already use a few iterable objects every day: strings, lists, and dictionaries to name a few.”

#### 4.7 Reducing Dimensionality from Dimensionality Reduction Techniques, by [Elior Cohen](https://medium.com/@eliorcohen)

In this post, Elior demystifies three **dimensionality reduction** techniques: **PCA, t-SNE, and Auto Encoders**.

> “The need to reduce dimensionality is often associated with visualizations (reducing to 2–3 dimensions so we can plot it) but that is not always the case. Sometimes we might value performance over precision so we could reduce 1,000 dimensional data to 10 dimensions so we can manipulate it faster (eg. calculate distances).”
